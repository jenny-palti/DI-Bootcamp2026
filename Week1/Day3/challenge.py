# 1. User Input:

# Ask the user to enter a word.
# Store the input word in a variable.
# 2. Creating the Dictionary:

# Iterate through each character of the input word using a loop.
# And check if the character is already a key in the dictionary.

#     * If it is, append the current index to the list associated with that key.
#     * If it is not, create a new key-value pair in the dictionary.
# Ensure that the characters (keys) are strings.
# Ensure that the indices (values) are stored in lists.
word = input("Enter a word: ")

character_indices = {}

    character = word[index]

    if character in character_indices:
        character_indices[character].append(index)

# 1. Store Data:

# You will be provided with a dictionary (items_purchase) where the keys are the item names and the values are their prices (as strings with a dollar sign). The priority is defined by the position of the iten on the dictionary: from the most important to the less important.
# You will also be given a string (wallet) representing the amount of money you have.
# 2. Data Cleaning:

# You need to clean the dollar sign and the commas using python. Don’t hard code it.
# 3. Determining Affordable Items:

# create a list called basket and add there the items that you can buy with the money you have on the wallet
# Don’t forget to update the wallet after buying an item.
# If the basket is empty (no items can be afforded), return the string “Nothing”.
# Otherwise, print the basket list in alphabetical order.
wallet = int(wallet.replace("$", "").replace(",", ""))

    price = int(price.replace("$", "").replace(",", ""))

        basket.append(item)
        wallet = wallet - price
